## üí° Development Tip

During development, it is recommended to **uncomment** the following line in `cdn.js` for easier testing without rebuilding Tailwind:

```javascript
// document.head.insertBefore(script, document.head.firstChild);
```

‚ö† **Important:** Re-comment this line before deploying to production to ensure the compiled Tailwind CSS file is used.
