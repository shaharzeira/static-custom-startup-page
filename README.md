This project displays a customizable grid of quick access link buttons that can be used as a custom browser start page.

## ðŸ”§ Customization

To personalize the dashboard:

1. **Edit the grid structure in `links_info.js`**  
   Each group in `linksInfo` defines a row of link cards.

2. **Add your own images**  
   Place your logo/icon files in the `images/` folder and reference their paths in `links_info.js`.

## ðŸš€ Set as Homepage

1. **Download or clone this project**  

2. **Open `home_page.html` in your browser**

3. **Copy the full file path from the address bar**  
   It should look like:  
   `file:///C:/Path/To/home_page.html`

4. **Paste this path into your browserâ€™s settings**  
   Look for the setting that allows a **custom URL for a new tab or homepage**, and paste the copied path.
